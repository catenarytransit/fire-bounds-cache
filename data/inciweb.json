By saturating these materials, the rain has significantly reduced surface fire behavior, slowed the fire\u0027s forward progression, and minimized visible smoke across the affected area. While overall fire activity has decreased due to the wet conditions, areas with heavy fuel loading remain a concern. These fuels can continue to smolder deep within the fire perimeter and may reignite surface fuels once conditions dry out.\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday, we pause to honor the sacrifice so many showed on 9-11-2001.
