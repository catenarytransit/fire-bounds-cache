The infrared heat scan is a great tool that is used to detect any heat source within the fire perimeter. The infrared image that is generated is transferred to a map and sent to the ground fire resources to help them seek and destroy any heat threats.

The initial fire was reported from a reconnaissance fire detection aircraft by the MMA (Multi Mission Aircraft). The MMA spotted a heat signature and reported the new start to the Montrose Interagency Fire Dispatch Center. The initial size up was .1 size, cause was lightning from the previous day, fire burning in grass, brush and timber. The new start was plotted on BLM land.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few hours later, gaining access to the fire, fire resources estimated the fire to be approximately 5 acres and named the incident the Muddy fire. Private property was within the proximity of the fire parameter and fire air resources were ordered to assist.
