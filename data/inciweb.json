In the south, firefighters focused on constructing and reinforcing direct fireline. Where conditions allowed, crews began mop-up up to 100 feet inside the perimeter to secure containment on the southeastern portion of the fire.

In the northwestern area, west of Devil Mountain and northeast of the OS\/Garnet Mountain Property Association (Reforestation Area), crews have a two-and-a-half-mile hoselay supported by portable tanks and pumps to reinforce containment and protect the subdivision. Additional hoselays are in place in the north and south, with more planned for the west side of the fire. These are designed to support holding operations and prevent fire spread beyond constructed lines. To date, firefighters have deployed over 35 miles of hose, 1,930 various fittings and nozzles, approximately 45 portable tanks and 40 pumps, supported by six water tenders that shuttle water to the tanks. Helicopters have delivered hose to inaccessible terrain and will also play a central role in planned aerial firing operations. Following equipment testing yesterday, helicopters will be used today to conduct aerial ignitions with a heli-torch and plastic sphere dispenser (PSD) if conditions are favorable. These tools allow firefighters to safely ignite vegetation under controlled conditions to strengthen containment. A qualified burn boss will oversee the operation, coordinating in real time with air attack and ground crews to ensure firing patterns meet objectives.
